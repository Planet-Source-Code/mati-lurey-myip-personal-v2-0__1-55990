### Description

MyIP Personal is a pretty small application I created for helping my friends play online games (internet and LAN). Features include: Your REAL IP and Hostname, Detects all computers connected via LAN (helpful to make sure everyone had a successful connection) and resides in the system tray. As an added bonus it has a quick link to scan your ports for weaknesses and exploits.
